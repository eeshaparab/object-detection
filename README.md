YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a popular and fast object detection algorithm that uses a single convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect objects in images and videos. It's considered a valuable tool for real-time applications because it can process images very quickly. 
Here's how YOLO works:
  Divide the image into a grid
  For each grid cell, predict multiple bounding boxes and class probabilities simultaneously
  Filter out low-confidence predictions
  Remove overlapping boxes using a technique called non-maximum suppression

Output the remaining guesses as rectangles and object labels 
YOLO's efficiency in balancing speed and accuracy makes it significant in the field of object detection. However, it has some limitations, such as being less accurate than other methods and struggling with small objects.
